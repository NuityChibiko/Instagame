### Overview ###
------------
In this example, the JSON below is returned from the remote server and parsed: 

``` json
{
	'cat': 'meow',
	'cow': 'moo',
	'fox': '???'
}
```
  
The following property is removed: 
``` json
'fox': '???'
```
And is replaced with: 
``` json 
'fox': 'ding ding ding'
``` 

### Run It!

### Code

``` js

var http = require('http');
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
var Edon = require('../bin/edon').Edon;

/* CONSTANTS */
var HOST = 'localhost';
var PORT = 9000;
var PROXY_PORT = 8000;

httpProxy.createServer(
  new Edon(function(json) {
    json.fox = 'frakakakaw';
  }),
  PORT,
  HOST
).listen(PROXY_PORT);

http.createServer(
  function(req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/json' });
    res.write(JSON.stringify({
      'cow': 'moo',
